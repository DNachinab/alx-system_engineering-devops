1. The primary single point of failure in this infrastructure lies in having just one load balancer.

2. Security issues arise from the absence of a firewall and the lack of HTTPS protocol. Communication over HTTP is insecure, potentially enabling attackers positioned in the middle to intercept sensitive information like passwords since HTTP transfers data in plain text. Additionally, the absence of a firewall opens avenues for attacks such as denial of service (DoS or DDoS), which could cause significant system downtime. Moreover, it leaves the system susceptible to malicious intrusions, allowing attackers to exploit open ports, conduct data exfiltration, and breach the system undetected.

3. The absence of monitoring represents a critical gap in the infrastructure. Monitoring the server, website, or application enables the owner to promptly detect and address issues, downtime, or security threats before they escalate into significant problems. This proactive approach not only enhances productivity but also potentially reduces costs on IT support. Moreover, monitoring contributes to an improved user experience by ensuring smoother operations and faster issue resolution.
