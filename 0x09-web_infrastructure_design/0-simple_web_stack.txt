1. A single point of failure (SPOF) refers to various vulnerable aspects within a system, such as relying on a single server housing the sole instances of a web server, application server, and database. When any of these components fail, the entire system ceases to function.

2. When maintenance is required, such as deploying new code that necessitates restarting the web server, downtime can extend beyond the anticipated duration. This occurs because the server relies on a single code base, which may be unavailable at that time. As a result, users are unable to access the website and its content, leading to a poor user experience and a decrease in traffic.

3. If there's a surge in incoming traffic, scaling becomes challenging. Since the domain name directly points to the server without a load balancer, managing increased loads becomes more difficult. This limitation impacts the website's ability to handle a high volume of users accessing its content, potentially resulting in a subpar user experience or imposing a cap on the number of users the website can support.
